BINARY TREE:
  Should have questions relating to terminology.
    Depth                - Find every node matching a certain depth
    Size                 - Find every node with a given size in the tree
    Height               - Find every node with a given height in the tree

  Should have questions relating to traversing a tree.
    Breadth First Search - Traverse every node in the tree BFS
    Depth First Search   - Traverse every node in the tree DFS
    In-Order Traversal   - Left, parent, right
    Pre-Order Traversal  - Parent, Left, Right
    Post-Order Traversal - Left, Right, Parent

  Every question would have selecting nodes, setting nodes as active.
    This logic is very, very similar to find, should be easy to implement.

  Needs to build up a tree when initialized, rather than adding to an empty tree.
    This would need to be implemented. I think best way to do this is:
      - Defs would have a variable determining whether or not to build.
      -  If build, would also give:
            - Min_Param
            - Max_Param
            - numAdditions
      - Which would perform numAdditions additions before-hand.
        - This logic could be placed inside of Exercise?
            Would likely be done somewhere just before initializing the answer
              for the first question...
