  4. Questions are off and need to be updated and fixarooed.
  5. Add indices for elements?
        See original dllist

  We need a way to determine the current size of the model for a given question.
    This would be needed for index where the index can be 0 <= i <= n, but
      n is changing - so we can't set it to be a constant.

ISSUES
  Dummy commonId is off for the first question.
    This has been patched, but in a terrible fashion. See Add-Base.js.
