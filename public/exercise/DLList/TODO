  5. Add indices for elements?
        See original dllist

  We need a way to determine the current size of the model for a given question.
    This would be needed for index where the index can be 0 <= i <= n, but
      n is changing - so we can't set it to be a constant.
    UPDATE: By changing order of generation this works.

ISSUES
  Dummy commonId is off for the first question.
    This has been patched, but in a terrible fashion. See Add-Base.js.
  If a node is added manually, when the view updates, it does not include that node.
    This is because commonId will be different ....... but it shouldn't be.
    What logic can we use for this?


CHANGES
  Parameters are generated AFTER the model.
  This SEEMS to be working but NEEDS more testing.
  CAPS are fun.
