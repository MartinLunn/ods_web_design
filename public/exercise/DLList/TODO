TODO:

  1.
  2. 
  3. View needs to set up a display
      needs to be built up somehow ...
      best is probably to keep previous positions while changing model
      will need some way to determine which nodes go with which
        mapTo ()
      and keeping the old nodes in the same position, pointing to new nodes
      then updating that model to reflect the change
